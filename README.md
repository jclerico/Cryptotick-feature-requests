Feature Request Tracker for CryptoTick iOS App

# CryptoTick Feature Request Tracker Repo

This repo is used to track user submitted feature requests for [CryptoTick iOS](https://cryptotick.co.uk). If you have a feature to request, check the “Issues” tab up above to see if it's already been requested, otherwise create a new ticket and add the gree 'feature request' tag.

### How do I request a feature?

To create a feature request, you'll first need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/).

Next, go to the “Issues” tab, select “New Issue” and fill out the form.

### How do I find out if my feature has already been requested?

Go to the “Issues” tab at the top, and use the search bar to see if your feature has already been requested. If it does exist, you can add more information/ideas via the discussion . If your feature request does not exist, please create a new ticket.

### What if I have a bug report, not a feature request?

Please see [this github repo](https://github.com/jclerico/Cryptotick-bugs)

### Can I participate in discussions here?

Yes you can! Please stay on topic to the specific feature request, and add any other variations/ideas youy have for it. If you just want to say "me too" (ie you want to request the same feature), use the + button with the smiley on a comment to indicate your reaction. This allows me to see what feature people want most.
